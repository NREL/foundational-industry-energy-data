FIED Updates

Significant updates were made to the FIED.


Reporting Year
==============

The reporting year has been updated to 2020 (GHGRP and NEI).


NAICS Code
==========

An updated method was implemented for assigning NAICS codes to facilities with more than code assigned in the Facility Registry Service (FRS).
The original method simply used the first value. The updated method selects a NAICS codes based on whether or not any duplicate NAICS codes are present, as well as which EPA reporting program has assigned the NAICS code.

Overall, applying the method resulted in changes to the NAICS code of 32,073, or 6.4%, of the original registryIDs. NAICS codes assigned by the new method also resulted in identifying nearly 15,000 additional industrial registryIDs, most of which are in the manufacturing sector (NAICS 31-33). 
The results of the updated method as it was applied to 2017 data are summarized in Table 1.
